## 1. Sources

`create_thumbnail_job` takes exactly one source. Sending `clip_id` together with another source is refused; sending none is refused with "A video link is required."

| Source | What FrameOS reads | Best for | Watch out for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `clip_id` | The clip's rendered video file | Shorts, Reels and TikTok covers; any project made from an uploaded file | On a `free` plan the frames include the small FrameOS watermark (paid plans with a brand logo show that logo instead) |
| `video_id` (the project ID) | The project's original source video | A thumbnail for the full episode, e.g. the main YouTube upload | Fails for uploaded-file projects - the source file is removed after rendering. Use a clip instead |
| `url` | A public video link, downloaded fresh | A video that is not in FrameOS yet | Must be a public link of the kind FrameOS can clip (YouTube, Vimeo, Twitch, Kick, public Google Drive file, direct video file). Long videos take longer to download |

The headline is written from what is said in the source. A clip gives a headline about that moment; a full video gives one about the whole episode.

## 2. Shapes per platform

`aspect` accepts `auto`, `16:9`, `9:16`, `1:1`, `4:5`, `3:4`. `auto` picks the supported shape closest to the source's frame, so a vertical clip gives 9:16.

| Use | `aspect` | Output size |
|---|---|---|
| YouTube video thumbnail (long-form) | `16:9` | 1280 x 720 |
| YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, TikTok cover | `9:16` | 1080 x 1920 |
| Instagram or Facebook feed image | `4:5` | 1080 x 1350 |
| Square placements (works on most feeds) | `1:1` | 1080 x 1080 |
| Portrait placements that use 3:4 | `3:4` | 1080 x 1440 |

Pass the shape explicitly whenever the target platform differs from the source shape - for example a 16:9 YouTube thumbnail from a vertical clip.

Non-vertical shapes and style references use a newer layout engine. If it cannot produce a design, FrameOS falls back to its vertical templates, and the results come back as 1080 x 1920 whatever shape was asked. Always compare `width` and `height` with the request and tell the user if they differ.

## 3. Cost and affordability

- 10 credits per thumbnail delivered. Failed jobs cost nothing.
- `max_thumbnails` is 1 to 3. Larger values are capped at 3. Never pass 0: it is treated as 3.
- FrameOS makes at most as many as the balance covers: affordable = balance divided by 10, rounded down. Example: a balance of 25 asked for 3 delivers at most 2 (20 credits). A balance under 10 is refused as out of credits.
- A job can deliver fewer images than asked even with enough credits (a design can fail); only delivered images are charged.
- The balance in `whoami` can lag by up to a minute. `get_usage` shows the live balance and recent spend, including thumbnails.
- Never quote prices or plans. For more credits, link https://frameos.studio/pricing.

What to say before starting (fill in the numbers):
"I'll make 3 thumbnail options at 10 credits each - 30 credits, charged only for the ones delivered. You have 140 credits."

## 4. Job progress and polling

- `create_thumbnail_job` returns `jobId` (camelCase) and status `queued`.
- `get_thumbnail_job` returns the job `state` (`pending`, `processing`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`), `progress` from 0 to 1, a `message`, a time estimate (about 120 s), and `result` once completed.
- Typical message order: queued, starting, downloading source (link and project sources), transcribing clip, matching your style (style reference or non-vertical shape) or sampling frames, finalizing, done.
- Cadence: first check about 20 s after starting, then every 10 s. Usually done in about 2 minutes; a long link can take several minutes to download.
- Stop after 15 minutes. A job still `pending` by then most likely never started; do not start another automatically. Check `list_thumbnails` later.
- There is no cancel tool. Never start a duplicate job while one is running - each delivered image is charged.

## 5. Result fields

When `state` is `completed`, `result` contains:

- `thumbnails`: a list, one item per image:
  - `url` - preview link (expires within hours)
  - `downloadUrl` - forced-download link (expires after about an hour)
  - `role` - short label, e.g. Best Match, Alternative, Wildcard, or a design name such as Scene Headline
  - `reason` - one sentence on why this design was chosen
  - `template` - internal design name (do not show it unless asked)
  - `width`, `height` - pixel size
  - a relative fit score (internal; do not show it)
- `title` - the headline idea in one line; also a decent video title suggestion
- `hook` - the headline pieces: `topic`, `kicker` (small line above), `line1`, `line2` (the big text), and a short rationale

`list_thumbnails` (newest first, `limit` 1 to 100, default 30) returns saved thumbnails with fresh links: `id`, `url`, `downloadUrl`, `template`, `role`, `title`, `width`, `height`, `jobId`, `createdAt`. It has no `reason`. Group rows by `jobId` to find one job's results.

## 6. Style references

`style_ref` is a link to one image of a thumbnail whose look the user wants.

What FrameOS takes from it:
- the layout family (for example a text panel beside a face, a full scene with a stacked headline)
- colours read from the image's pixels
- borders and the text panel's side and width
- a logo or channel name from its corner, which may be placed on the new thumbnails

Good references:
- One of the user's own past thumbnails - this keeps a channel consistent and avoids copying someone else's logo.
- A clear, uncluttered thumbnail at normal thumbnail size.

Rules:
- It must be a direct `https` link to an image file (jpg or png), publicly reachable. A web page link, a login-only link or a private file will not work.
- If the image cannot be downloaded, the job still runs with the house style and gives no warning. If the results look nothing like the reference, say so.
- Do not encourage copying another creator's branding. If the user points at someone else's thumbnail, mention that a logo or name from it may be carried over and should be checked before use.
- Never pass storage paths (gs:// links) as a style reference.

## 7. Designs and labels

Vertical jobs without a style reference use the classic templates. Their labels are Best Match, Alternative and Wildcard, in that order.

The newer engine (non-vertical shapes or a style reference) uses design families. Labels you may see:
- Scene Headline - the full scene kept, with a bold stacked headline
- Cutout Duo - people cut out as stickers, with a bubble headline and name labels
- Flat Illustrated - flat colour background with drawn doodles, cutouts and name pills
- Data Story - a video-frame card with fact cards built from numbers spoken in the video
- Layout Transfer - the reference's layout reproduced: panel, face position and border

All of these are made from the video's own frames plus drawn shapes and text. None of them generate new imagery.

## 8. Presenting results

Keep it short. Example:

```
Your 3 thumbnail options (16:9, 1280 x 720):
1. Best Match - <reason>. Preview: <url>  Download: <downloadUrl>
2. Alternative - <reason>. Preview: <url>  Download: <downloadUrl>
3. Wildcard - <reason>. Preview: <url>  Download: <downloadUrl>
Headline: "<line1> <line2>"  (suggested title: "<title>")
Charged: 30 credits. Links expire - ask me for fresh ones any time.
```

Then offer next steps: a different shape, a style reference, or a new run (each new run costs again).

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Next step |
|---|---|---|
| Out of credits when starting | Balance under 10 | Link https://frameos.studio/pricing. Do not retry. |
| Fewer images than asked | Balance covered fewer, or a design failed | Say how many were delivered and charged. |
| Asked for 16:9, got 1080 x 1920 | Newer layout engine fell back to vertical | Offer one new attempt (costs again), possibly from another source. |
| Results ignore the style reference | The image link could not be downloaded or was a web page | Ask for a direct public image link. |
| Headline looks generic or unrelated | The speech could not be used, so the headline fell back to the title | Offer a run from a different source (costs again). |
| Job failed for a project made from an uploaded file | Source file was removed after rendering | Use `clip_id`. |
| Job failed with a download error | Private, removed or unsupported link | Ask for another public link or use a clip. |
| Job failed: "Thumbnail generation failed" or "Could not generate thumbnails for that video" | Processing error | Nothing was charged. Try a clip as the source, after asking. |
| Job stuck in `pending` for 15 minutes | The job did not start | Stop polling; check `list_thumbnails` later. Do not start another job without asking. |
| Links stopped working | Signed links expired | Call `list_thumbnails` for fresh links. |
